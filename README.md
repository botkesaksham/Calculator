# Calculator

I created a calculator as a personal project to practice my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator was designed using HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and responsive user interface, and JavaScript was used to provide the necessary functionalities, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I also added a clear and delete button to improve the user experience.
